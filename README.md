# AdaFilter â€” Signal Recovery via Adaptive Filtering

AdaFilter provides implementation of signal/image denoising via adaptive filtering. 

$$ Short description

The goal is to estimate a signal $x = (x_t),$

In a nutshell, one fits a data-dependent time-invariant filter by solving an appropriate (well-structured) convex optimization problem. 
This approach allows to adapt to the unknown shift-invariant structure of the signal, encompassing, in particular, signals satisfying low-order ODEs and PDEs, and more generally, signals
