# AdaFilter â€” Signal Denoising via Adaptive Filtering

AdaFilter provides a **MATLAB** implementation of struture-adaptive denoising of discrete-time signals and images.

## Short description

The approach is to fit from the observations a time-invariant filter which *reproduces the vector of observations with a small error, and at the same time has small norm in the DFT domain.* This is done by solving a convex optimization problem (namely a well-structured SOCP).
The resulting estimator is shown to be adaptive to the unknown shift-invariant structure of the signal. Thus, the following signals are addressed:
- signals belonging to low-dimensional shift-invariant linear subspaces; equivalently, discretized solutions of low-order ODEs and PDEs, and in particular, sums of complex sinusoids;
- more generally, signals that are well-approximated in such subspaces; this includes the classical case of discretized smooth functions.

All the details regarding the theoretical motivation, statistical performance, and algorithmic implementation of the outlined approach can be found in [1,2,3]. We also plan to release the code reproducing the experimental results of those papers.

## Installation
Download or clone the repository, then change to the code directory: 
```
>> cd adafilter-master/code
``` 

## Usage and Documentation
The user deals with function ``filter_recovery`` implemented in file ``filter_recovery.m``. This function accepts three parameters: 1D or 2D array of observations ``y``, structure ``params`` with denoising parameters, and structure ``solver_control`` with parameters of the filter fitting procedure. 

and the documentation is available at 

## Features
As of Feb. 2018, the following features are implemented:

## Demos
We provide "numerical tours" to demonstrate application of our approach to different signals in 1D and 2D. In **MATLAB** command line, type:
```
>> demo1d       % Run a demonstration of 1D-denoising
>> demo2d       % Run a demonstration of 2D-denoising
```
In order for the images to be saved as .pdf files, MATLAB must be able to write into the parent folder of ``code``

One can also publish both scripts as .pdf or .html documents. For that, go to **Publish** tab in the main menu of the Matlab GUI, and then press **Publish**. The options can be edited in the dropdown menu.
